General
-------

FTPbox is an open-source application that allows you to synchronize your files to your own host, via FTP. This way, you can access your files anywhere, without having to pay for disk space on some 3rd-party website!

Main Features
-------------

FTPbox makes synchronizing your files to your own host easy, so you can access them from anywhere. FTPbox supports both SFTP (FTP over SSH) and FTPS (SSL/TLS encryption), so that your file transfers are always safe, and also works offline, which means that any changes made while you were not connected to the internet will be applied once you get connected.   In order to easily access your files, FTPbox provides you with links to them. You can use these links either to check your files in browser, or to send them to your friends in order to share the file with them!

Easy to Use
-----------

FTPbox can be set up in seconds! You only have to fill in your FTP account's information and select local and remote paths to sync. After that, FTPbox will stay minimized in tray and work 
in the background. Any change to your local folder will be applied to the remote folder, and vice versa.
FTPbox is available in more than 20 languages.
